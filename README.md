Sometime, I need to choose a react state management tool, But it has too many.
so, I chose some and wrote some demos to experience the differences between them.
You can use Tailwind and Antd in there.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
```

Next
```bash
npm run dev
```
